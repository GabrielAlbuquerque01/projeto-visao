Concerts from this tour were elaborate multimedia spectacles that Bono performed as a variety of characters , but for the end of the main set , the group reverted to playing classics , including "" Where the Streets Have No Name "" , straight .

The state later included these trails as part of M ‑ 12 when the first state highway trunklines were designated in 1919 . Most of M ‑ 12 was redesignated as part of US 2 when the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 . Since the 1930s , several changes have reshaped the highway 's routing through the UP . One such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with Hurley , Wisconsin , and others pushed an originally inland routing of US 2 closer to the Lake Michigan shoreline . With the creation of the Interstate Highway System , part of US 2 was rerouted to coincide with the new Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) , though in the 1980s , the U.S. Highway was truncated and removed from the I ‑ 75 freeway , resulting in today 's basic form .

Although many more Aborigines died than British , this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans . Aboriginal tactics varied , but were mainly based on pre @-@ existing hunting and fighting practices — using spears , clubs and other primitive weapons . Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America , on the main Aborigines failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans . Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms , this was not widespread . The Aborigines were never a serious military threat to European settlers , regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them . On occasions large groups of Aborigines attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued , during which the Aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage . This could sometimes be effective , with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents , waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded . However , such open warfare usually proved more costly for the Aborigines than the Europeans .

Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot , which was then beneath southeastern Oregon , induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17 million years ago , in the Miocene . The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the Trout Creek Mountains . Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years , and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred . Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon .

The "" Tikal hiatus "" refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large @-@ scale construction at Tikal . In the latter half of the 6th century AD , a serious crisis befell the city , with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture . This hiatus in activity at Tikal was long unexplained until later epigraphic decipherments identified that the period was prompted by Tikal 's comprehensive defeat at the hands of Calakmul and the Caracol polity in AD 562 , a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of Tikal . The badly eroded Altar 21 at Caracol described how Tikal suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in April 562 . It seems that Caracol was an ally of Calakmul in the wider conflict between that city and Tikal , with the defeat of Tikal having a lasting impact upon the city . Tikal was not sacked but its power and influence were broken . After its great victory , Caracol grew rapidly and some of Tikal 's population may have been forcibly relocated there . During the hiatus period , at least one ruler of Tikal took refuge with Janaab ' Pakal of Palenque , another of Calakmul 's victims . Calakmul itself thrived during Tikal 's long hiatus period .

These navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities , forcing the separate colonies to subsidise the cost of a British naval squadron in their waters for decades . The colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901 , when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created . This new force also lacked blue water capable ships , and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy . In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell , while attending the Imperial Conference in London , sought the British Government 's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy . The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge , but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient . Deakin was unimpressed , and in 1908 invited the American Great White Fleet to visit Australia . This visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700 @-@ ton River @-@ class destroyers . The surge in German naval construction prompted the Admiralty to change their position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in 1911 , absorbing the Commonwealth Naval Force . On 4 October 1913 , the new fleet steamed through Sydney Heads , consisting of the battlecruiser HMAS Australia , three light cruisers , and three destroyers , while several other ships were still under construction . And as a consequence the navy entered the First World War as a formidable force .
